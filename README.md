# Stop2FA
No two-factor Auth requirements

GitHub, let me decide how I want my account secured. 

2FA is NOT "more secure" than a good password.

I really hate 2FA. I already have experience of losing data because of it. STOP 2FA PLEASE !!!

My projects will remain here. I'm not going to delete them, however, and I'm not going to improve them here.
